    <h3>You're now being presented with a series of rating scales.</h3>
    <p>For each of the six scales, evaluate the task you recently performed by moving the slider bars to the location that matches your experience. Each line has two endpoint descriptors that describe the scale.</p>
    <p>Consider your responses carefully in distinguishing among the different task conditions, and consider each scale individually.</p>
